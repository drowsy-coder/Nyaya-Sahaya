We have developed a technology driven solution that tackles the complex challenges faced by the common people, especially the undertrials in India.
The most critical area of concern is the provision of legal aid, which would be needed by those facing trials, and their families to contact lawyers. They also require proper representation in courts, alongwith knowledge and tools necessary to be able to seek justice for themselves.
Another great concern was the absence of a bridge between lawyers and the undertrials. This makes it tougher to connect with pro-bono lawyers, legal clinics and legal aid organisations. A bridge would be needed to facilitate the entire legal journey - from bail to courts and to support whenever needed.
These issues have been resolved through our in-app connect section where those facing trials can gain insights into their case and can connect with lawyers around them. The tools that are provided allow common people to seek insights about the case and get knowledge about the case from within the app.
Most people facing cases are unaware about their rights and the provisions pertaining to undertrial prisoners. Spreading awareness is still a step that needs to be taken to improve support for people facing trials. This is seconded by the lack of rehabilitation programs - where undertrials would need significant counselling, support and educational and mental health resources to integrate back into the society, and become a functioning member of the society.
We have provided mental health support resources and we have also provided educational resources for undertrials to be able to integrate into the society with ease. Our support section helps them seek help whenever they face mental health issues.
